# Solidus demo with account page from solidus_auth_devise

The bundled version of Solidus does not include the account page yet, it's the standard Solidus from rubygems.

The bundled version of `solidus_auth_devise` can be used with a Solidus version that does not include the
account page (the one bundled in this app) or with a Solidus version that includes it (this will happen in another demo app).

This app can be used to experiment and verify if everything works as expected.
